## 🔔 Latest updates

### 🎤 NEW: Real-Time Audio Chat & Enhanced Voice Features
- **Audio Chat**: Record voice messages from your laptop microphone and send them directly to the Pi speaker for instant two-way communication
- **Multi-Engine Hindi TTS**: Enhanced text-to-speech system with gTTS for quality, pyttsx3 for offline use, and espeak as fallback
- **Smart Reminder System**: Schedule voice reminders with detailed logging and automatic delivery through the Pi speaker
- **Voice Assistant Dashboard**: New `/assistant` page in the frontend with comprehensive voice communication controls

### 🤖 Assistant & Communication Features  
- Dashboard now includes a **Chirpy assistant console** that lets you chat with the Pi voice agent directly from the browser. All requests are relayed over the new `/assistant/message` API.
- A **reminder scheduler with optional voice notes** is exposed at `/assistant/reminders`, allowing timed announcements that play automatically through the Pi speaker.
- Cross-origin requests are enabled on the Pi server so the Vite frontend can dispatch robot commands and assistant actions without extra proxies.
- Introduced **multi-mode behaviour**—including Care Companion, Watchdog, and Edumate—with synced alerts, dashboard controls to silence alarms, and automatic history summaries.

### 📋 Setup & Usage
- 📘 For fresh installs, follow the end-to-end [deployment & usage guide](./SETUP_AND_USAGE.md).
- 🛠️ Want a speaker-only Pi? Leave `PI_ASSISTANT_MODE` at the default `fallback` and skip the GitHub Models token—voice notes still play through the on-device TTS engine.
- 🎤 To use audio chat: Update Pi server with `wget -O pi_camera_server.py 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ishpreet404/roboGaurdian/main/pi_camera_server_fixed.py'`

### **AI Not Detecting:**### Command Logic

1. Check YOLO model download in Windows app

2. Verify camera stream quality- **Lateral Movement**: Subject center offset > 100px from frame center → Left/Right.

3. Adjust confidence threshold in GUI- **Depth Movement**: Bounding box height < 150px → Forward (subject far); > 350px → Backward (too close); else Stop.
